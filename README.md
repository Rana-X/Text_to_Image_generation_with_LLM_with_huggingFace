This guide explains how to use half-precision (FP16) with Stable Diffusion models to optimize memory usage and improve performance.
What is Half Precision?
Half-precision (FP16) is a way of representing numbers using 16 bits instead of 32 bits (FP32). This reduces memory usage by approximately 50% with minimal impact on output quality.
Benefits

Reduced VRAM usage (up to 50% less)
Faster model loading times
Quicker inference speed
Ability to run larger models on consumer GPUs
Minimal quality loss in generated images

Requirements

Python 3.8+
PyTorch with CUDA support
transformers
diffusers
NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 7.0+
6GB+ VRAM (recommended)
